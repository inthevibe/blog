<div class="text-white justify-center">
So I decided to make a blog just to experiment with Frontend, and it turned out to be more complicated than I expected?
<p>It all started while following people on Twitter, I realised that everyone has a blog to document a bit of their journey when it comes to learning
or to just share knowledge with others about their discoveries. I found the idea interesting and also liked the fact that the website could work like so some sort of diary.
Also, they say that writing things makes them more real. Who's they? Psychologists I guess ðŸ‘€

<h2 class="font-bold text-1xl mb-2">Picking a Framework?</h2>
So the first thing that came to mind was that I need some sort of templating framework or similar, something to generate the posts from a Markdown file.
